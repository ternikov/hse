#### Movie Dataset

1. Upload the data from [here](https://bit.ly/2A2zkI6) into pandas DataFrame and display the first 10 rows.
2. Calculate number of observations.
3. Extract frequency table by `content_rating` column.
4. Using previous data from exercise 3 \(use top-5 by frequency\), create bar chart \(sort columns in decreasing way\).
5. Create the histogram of films' `duration` for films with `budget` more than 1 million.
6. Calculate the mean `duration` for two film categories: with `budget` more than 1 million and otherwise.
7. Calculate the mean, min and max duration of films with `imdb_score` more than 7.5 by year.
8. Calculate the number of unique genres \(use `genres`, split by `|`\).
9. Create scatter plot: x-axis - `duration`, y-axis - `imdb_score`, points' color - `color`.
10. Calculate the frequency table of actor names \(combine 3 columns for your analysis\) for `Action` movie genre. Display TOP-5 actors.
