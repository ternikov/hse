#### Job Dataset

1. Upload the data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ternikov/hse/gh-pages/folder/dataTue1.csv) into pandas DataFrame, drop the first column and display the first 15 rows.
2. Calculate the number of missing values \(`NaN`\) in column `Hourly Rate`.
3. Calculate the number of unique `Job Titles` in "POLICE" Department.
4. Calculate the shares \(among all workers of particular department\) of Full-time workers \[`F`\] for each `Department`.
5. Find out the number of unique `Job Titles` \(for each `Department`\). Create bar chart \(number of unique `Job Titles` by `Department`\). Display TOP-5 departments by the number of unique `Job Titles`. Sort bars in decreasing way.
6. Extract the data, where `Annual Salary` is provided. Calculate the average annual salary for full-time workers by each `Department`. Sort values in decreasing way.
7. Use an initial data. Based on given data \(`Typical Hours` are given for one working week\), fill-in missing values in `Annual Salary` \(assume 35 working weeks in a year for all\). Display the first 15 rows of obtained dataset.
8. Using the data obtained in exercise 7, calculate the number of observations and average `Annual Salary` for engineers \(`Job Titles` should contain "ENGINEER"\) by `Department`s.
9. Using the data obtained in exercise 7, check the hypothesis \(use `t`-test\): there is no difference in mean `Annual Salary` between people, who works in "POLICE" department, and the others. Comment the result.
10. Provide the list of `Job Titles` that are mostly occurred in different departments \(professions that are provided in the most of departments\).
