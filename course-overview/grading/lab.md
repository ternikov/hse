# LAB

LAB \(in-class activity\) consists of 10 exercises \(each of 1 point\). Students can work **individually** or in small-groups **up to five** students \(all students from the small-group will obtain the same grade\). In case of plagiarism - the particular exercise is assessed as 0 \(zero\) points.

### Process Organization

* The Lab should be done during the class \(1 hour 20 minutes\) that is stated in your timetable \(you can choose any time from the timetable and work in mixed-groups but it is recommended to participate in the Lab with the group \[BMN...\] that is formally assigned to you\) .
* Each small-group \(or one student if he/she is working individually\) creates their own joint conference in MS Teams / Zoom.
* During the Lab the group should be complete \(each participant's webcam should be switched on\). Each group member should participate in the work \(incomplete and inactive groups will not be assessed\). Share the working screen\(s\) during the Lab. 
* The whole Lab stream should be recorded \(if the Lab will not be recorded with both valid audio and valid video streams - the Lab will not be assessed\).
* After you finish the Lab: 
  * publish your video recording in your own cloud service \(Google Drive, Yandex Disk, OneDrive, etc.\);
  * paste your small-group members' names and the link with the access to your video stream into your file with solutions;
  * send this file with solutions \(one submit per each small-group\) in LMS system not later than two hours after the end of the class \(late submits of the same day will be 20% penalized; late submits of the next day\(s\) will be 100% penalized\).
