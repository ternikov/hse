[Classroom for GitHub](https://github.com/education/classroom) is basically an application that helps you make private copies of an assignment that you can modify and submit as your answers for the exercises. The following template is created for a typical assignment:

* A basic description of the assignment
* A list of problems for you to solve/answer
* Some _starter_ **Jupyter Notebook** or **Python code** that you need to modify for the assignment
* Some data files to use with the code

For each exercise, the special invitation link is published:`https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/...`.

When you click the link, you will be taken to a web page where you can accept the assignment

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note** that the first time you accept an assignment you will need to authorize the application on GitHub with your `@edu.hse.ru`. This will not work if you have not verified your email address for your Github account.
{% endhint %}

When you accept the assignment a copy of it will be made in your personal GitHub repositories \(a repository on GitHub is basically like a folder for a given assignment/project\), and you will be asked to make changes to the Python code and main document for each assignment.
